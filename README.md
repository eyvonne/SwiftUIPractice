# SKSDContactTracker
A tool to simplify contact tracing for a hypothetical Public School district custodial services

This tool was built to facilitate contact tracing within the custodial team. It takes in data in the form of an excel spreadsheet with the following layout:


| Dates  | Name 1   | Name 2   | Name 3   | Name 4   |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Shifts | Shift | Shift | Shift | Shift |
| Date 1 | Location | Location | Location | Location |
| Date 2 | Location | Location | Location | Location |
| Date 3 | Location | Location | Location | Location |

The tool assumes that the dates are entered sequentially.
